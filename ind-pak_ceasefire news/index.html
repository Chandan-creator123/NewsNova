        <p>In a significant diplomatic breakthrough, India and Pakistan have agreed to a full and immediate cease-fire along the Line of Control (LoC) in Kashmir. This decision comes after extensive negotiations led by U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Antony Blinken.</p>
        <p class="text1">Hours after India and Pakistan reached an understanding on stopping military actions, Foreign Secretary Vikram Misri said that Pakistan has repeatedly violated the ceasefire understanding arrived at on Saturday (May 10, 2025) and that the Indian armed forces are giving an “adequate and appropriate” response to the attacks. <br> <br>

In a late night media briefing, Mr. Misri called upon Pakistan to take appropriate steps to address these violations and deal with the situation with “seriousness and responsibility”. <br> <br>

    “For the last few hours, there have been repeated violations of the understanding arrived at earlier this evening between the Directors General of Military Operations of India and Pakistan. This is a breach of the understanding arrived at earlier today. The armed forces are giving an adequate and appropriate response to these violations and we take very very serious note of these violations,” he said.

The earlier announcement of ceasefire by the Foreign Secretary came shortly after U.S. President Donald Trump said India and Pakistan have agreed to a “full and immediate” ceasefire after talks mediated by the U.S.

The ceasefire was announced after a meeting between the two countries’ military chiefs, which was mediated by the U.S. and took place in Washington, D.C. The meeting was attended by U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and U.S. National Security Adviser John Bolton.

</p>
<p class="text3"> Following the ceasefire announcement, several international observers expressed cautious optimism, urging both nations to maintain open communication channels. The United Nations Secretary-General called on both India and Pakistan to adhere to their commitments and to focus on confidence-building measures. <br><br>
Tensions along the Line of Control (LoC) have historically disrupted lives on both sides, affecting thousands of civilians. Local authorities in border regions reported that while shelling had reduced since the announcement, sporadic gunfire continued in some areas, keeping residents on edge. <br><br>

<p class="text4"> Diplomatic sources indicate that further bilateral meetings are being considered under the supervision of neutral international facilitators to solidify the ceasefire terms. Meanwhile, humanitarian agencies are preparing to assess and address any damages in the conflict zones once stability is ensured. <br><br>
Experts say that this ceasefire could mark a turning point if both countries demonstrate sustained commitment. However, they warn that mistrust and provocation could unravel progress if not vigilantly managed. <br><br>

</p> 
<p class="text5"> The Indian Ministry of External Affairs reiterated its stance that peace is only possible if Pakistan stops cross-border terrorism. On the other hand, Pakistan’s foreign office stated that the ceasefire reflects its desire for regional peace, provided mutual respect and dialogue are maintained. <br><br>
    
    
    <p class="text6"> In New Delhi, political leaders across party lines issued statements welcoming the ceasefire, though many emphasized the need for constant vigilance. Opposition leaders urged the government to keep Parliament informed about developments and called for transparency in future negotiations with Pakistan. <br><br>
